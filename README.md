# Data Analysis Project: Euthanasia Trends in Coimbatore's Pet Population

## Project Overview
This project analyzes euthanasia trends among canine and feline populations in Coimbatore, India. It involves data collection from local pet hubs and veterinary care centers, followed by preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to derive meaningful insights.

## Project Structure
- `datavis_data.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis
- `file_perfect.xlsx`: Dataset used for the analysis
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project

## Data Collection
Data was collected from various pet hubs and vet care centers around Coimbatore. The dataset includes variables such as age, state, temperature, year, organizations, stages, Covid dependency, euthanasia total, basis of euthanasia, and intake/live release/other outcomes for both feline and canine populations.

## Analysis Process
1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, normalization
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Temporal analysis, correlation studies
3. Visualization: Time series plots, heat maps, bar charts, geospatial visualizations

## Key Findings
(Note: Replace with actual findings from your analysis)
1. Observed trends in euthanasia rates over time
2. Correlation between environmental factors and euthanasia rates
3. Impact of COVID-19 on pet intake and euthanasia decisions
4. Comparative analysis between feline and canine populations

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- Matplotlib and Seaborn
- Tableau
